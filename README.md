## How to Use


## How to Run Locally

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**
	- Download the ZIP file and extract it, or use:
	  ```sh
	  git clone <repository-url>
	  ```

2. **Open the Project Folder**
	- Navigate to the extracted folder on your computer.

3. **Start a Local Server (Recommended)**
	- For best results, use a local server to avoid issues with loading JavaScript and CSS files.
	- You can use extensions like "Five Server" or "Live Server" in VS Code, or run a simple Python server:
	  ```sh
	  python -m http.server
	  ```

4. **Open the Website in Your Browser**
	- Go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown by your server).
	- Open `index.html` for the homepage, or explore other HTML files.
