What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning allows the systems to make decisions autonomously without any external support.

These decisions are made when the machine is able to learn from the data and understand the underlying patterns that are contained within it.

Then, through pattern matching and further analysis, they return the outcome which can be a classification or a prediction.

Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning - Supervised Learning is the most popular paradigm for performing machine learning operations. It is widely used for data where there is a precise mapping between input-output data.

Unsupervised Learning - In the case of an unsupervised learning algorithm, the data is not explicitly labeled into different classes, that is, there are no labels. The model is able to learn from the data by finding implicit patterns.

Reinforcement Learning - Reinforcement Learning covers more area of Artificial Intelligence. This allows machines to interact with their dynamic environment in order to reach their goals. 


Example 

Smart Attendance Predictor Using Machine Learning

This system predicts whether a student is Present or Absent based on simple factors like:

Previous attendance

Class time

Day of the week

Why is this a good invention?

Simple idea

Real-life problem

Uses basic machine learning

Easy to explain to teachers

Problem

Teachers spend time checking attendance.
Some students often miss classes.
This invention helps predict attendance early.

Inputs and Output

Inputs:

Attendance last week (Present / Absent)

Day (Weekday / Weekend)

Class time (Morning / Afternoon)

Output:

Prediction: Present or Absent

Example Data
| Last Week | Day     | Time      | Result  |
| --------- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Present   | Weekday | Morning   | Present |
| Absent    | Weekday | Morning   | Absent  |
| Present   | Weekend | Afternoon | Absent  |
