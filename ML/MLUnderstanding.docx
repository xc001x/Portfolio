What I Have Learned About Machine Learning

Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and 
 improve their performance without being directly programmed for every task.
Instead of following only fixed rules, machines use patterns from data to make decisions or predictions.

One important thing I learned is that machine learning depends heavily on data. The more accurate and relevant the data is, the better the machine can learn. For example,
if a machine is trained to recognize pictures of cats, it needs many clear examples of cat images to learn correctly.

I also learned that there are different types of machine learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data, where the correct answers are already known.
Unsupervised learning works with data that has no labels and tries to find hidden patterns
There is also reinforcement learning, where machines learn by trial and error, receiving rewards for correct actions.

Machine learning is used in many areas of daily life, such as recommendation systems, voice assistants, medical diagnosis, and self-driving cars.
Learning about machine learning helped me understand how technology can adapt and become smarter over time.
